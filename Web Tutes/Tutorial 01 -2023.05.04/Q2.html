            <p>Sri Lanka has two nicknames; the 'pearl of the Indian ocean' and the 'teardrop of India'. The country gets its first nickname due to its natural beauty, incredible biodiversity and the precious gemstones that are exported out of the country. Its second nickname is due to the country's location and its shape.</p>
